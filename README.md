# LiverDiseaseDetection
The main objective of this project is to use classification algorithms to detect the liver patients from healthy individuals. In this study, THREE classification algorithms Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been considered for comparing their performance based on the liver patient data. Further, the model with the highest accuracy is implemented as a user-friendly GUI using the Tkinter package in python. The GUI can be easily utilized by doctors and medical practitioners as a screening tool for liver disease.
